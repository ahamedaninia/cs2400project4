Heaps. This project was created by Alex Hamedaninia. I was given the data_sorted.txt and data_random.txt and I created the MaxHeap.java file with assistance from my textbook and class notes. I designed the MaxHeapDriver to test my files.

The program uses generic datatypes and contains the MaxHeapInterface.
